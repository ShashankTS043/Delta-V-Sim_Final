# Contributing to Delta-V Sim

Thank you for your interest in contributing! As this is a time-sensitive hackathon project, we are not actively seeking external pull requests at this moment.

However, if you have a suggestion or find a bug, please feel free to open an "Issue" on the GitHub repository.

## Our Development Workflow

1.  All work is done on the `develop` branch.
2.  Please ensure any new code is formatted and tested before creating a pull request.
3.  All commits should follow a clear and descriptive message format (e.g., "feat: Add energy cost model").
